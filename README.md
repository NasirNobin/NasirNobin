Howdy, I'm Nasir and I love to write codes since I was a kid. I'm very passionate about what I'm doing. Love to solve practical problems and automate stuff with coding!

As for the technical side: 
- I'm professionally experienced in Laravel, PHP, Vue.js for building applications.
- I try not to limit myself to a specific stack. I use Python, Node.js, Bash Scripting all the time for building automation scripts.
- I also use Serverless, Docker, Ubuntu, AWS, and other cloud stuff as needed to deploy applications in scalable infrastructure!
